# Plotter art

## Quick start

- Get an [axidraw](https://axidraw.com/). They're super fun and easy to use.
- Follow the [quick start guide](https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/AxiDraw).
- Once you've made your first test print, switch to advanced mode... clone this repo, then install the Axidraw library.

  ```
  pip3 install pyaxidraw
  ```

You can now run any of the prints. For example, try `python3 random_walk.py`.

The plotter will do a random walk. Each print is a surprise. For results like the photo above, run it once, switch pens, then run it again. Play with the parameters.

You can also use Dall-E with prompts like "a twirling ballerina, one-line art" or "line drawing", then use Inkscape's built-in Trace Bitmap tool to get a printable SVG.

For best results, I recommend 9" by 12" unbleached art paper.
